			<b>BODY ISSUES</b><br><br>
			11 years old.<br>
			Victoria, the white cat, had held me under her spell for years - and I had nagged mum to let me do ballet.<br>
			And finally mum enrolled in a ballet class;<br>
			After I copied my cousins at the back of the room in their grade 4 preparation.<br>
			Within a year of starting dance, becoming a ballerina was the only thing I could dream of as a career move. I loved hard work, I loved discipline, I loved body work - and still do. Then one day, puberty struck. My legs got longer, breasts grew, those little underarm hairs started sprouting, and the dreaded monthly bleeding came at 14.<br>
			Come 15 years, my teacher sat me down and had a ‘difficult’ conversation with me.
		</p>
		<p class="testimonial-text testimonial-quote">
			“Now I know it’s really stuck in your head that you want to be a ballet dancer. And let me tell you, when you first came in at 11, I thought you had the perfect body type to survive that world. But unfortunately now I can see exactly what your body type is:<br>
			Your bones are too big.<br>
			Your body is too broad.<br>
			Your legs have too much fat on them.<br>
			You also lack the intelligence that most ballet dancers need.<br>
			Say you went to St. Margarets, like some of the other girls (a fancy private school),<br>
			You might actually have the ability to get into a ballet school.
		</p>
		<p class="testimonial-text testimonial-quote">
			I don’t want to give you those false expectations. As it stands - and I’m saying this because I care about you - you’re just not the type for ballet. You might be a good contemporary dancer though. There’s a bit more leeway and you can be a fat dancer”
		</p>
		<p class="testimonial-text">
			Already I had taught myself to not cry, after a BBO Concourse at Southern Ballet in Christchurch, when a teacher kept picking on me. I had told my mum that I nearly bawled in the class, and she laughed and told me that “the teacher could probably see that you were going to cry, better hold it back better.” So sure enough, that learned behaviour, on top of a conversation about body image made me hold it in & in & in & in. And now, like many ex-ballet dancers, I look in the mirror and have that little OCD voice coming back to tell me I’m too big. I don’t cry because I’m scared it will make me seem weak. I grit my teeth and pretend I’m okay. I have nagging voices telling me to be doing better, to be skinnier, smarter, better. As ballet dancers, we’re not taught to celebrate our achievements. Perfection is clear in the lines and form of the dance, and if you can’t attain that, you’re a failure.

			<b>SILENCING AUTHENTICITY</b><br><br>
			I asked ‘why?’ a lot - And was labelled with the name ‘rebel’ In my dance and theatre classes.
		</p>
		<p class="testimonial-text">
			I wanted to know <i>why</i>. And <i>how</i>. I wanted teachers to <b>back up</b> their statements. I liked the art of disagreeing until I could be convinced (or not). I liked understanding on a deep level; more than just rationality.
		</p>
		<p class="testimonial-text">
			And many times, I spoke against things I saw as damaging or illogical. I was told either: <i>“You’re too egotistical,” “You don’t trust me,” “You let your brain get in the way,”</i> (a fair point) <i>“You won’t do well if you question authority,” “You asking so many questions makes me know you don’t really want this, and you’re avoiding the work.” </i>
		</p>
		<p class="testimonial-text">
			And more often than not, those shut downs allowed spaces for those in power to manipulate, boundary-cross, bully, harass, and emotionally abuse.
		</p>
		<p class="testimonial-text">
			This is a commonality amongst many dancers, artists, choreographers etc. And it gets accepted as the ‘norm,’ and passes down from generation to generation.
		</p>
		<p class="testimonial-text">
			Ballet in my experience, created a space for the dancer to be silent. It is hierarchical. And it bleeds into other aspects of our lives. It appeals to the part of us that wants praise and care; while also causing us to silence the most authentic, curious, intuitive parts of ourselves. And that is not only reflective in the individual, but in our systems. New Zealand Dance has not had a proper Dancer’s Union for years; something that should be essentials for all workers.
		</p>
		<p class="testimonial-text">
			So now the work is to undo the old ways of doing things. To stand against the unsustainable, power-hungry, emotionally/financially/mentally abusive functions, and to begin to learn our voices. To speak when things are out of order. To ask for what we’re worth. To value our skills, and admit and allow our faults. To restructure a system which has slowly been collapsing over time, and rebuild from the ground up. With our voices, our bodies, our minds, our breath, and our collective spirits.
