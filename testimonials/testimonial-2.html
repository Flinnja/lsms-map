			Strange to love something like dance, because in fact it’s just the act of moving in time and space but when you make the decision to do it professionally, by which I mean, try to earn money from it and do all the training that that entails there’s a lot of BS you welcome into your life.

			In my time as a dancer I have experienced debilitating eating disorders that range from extreme anorexia to a binge eating disorder. I struggle with food and my body everyday. The eating disorder is a chicken and egg scenario for me, because on the one hand, maybe I was drawn to dance because of my proclivity towards disordered eating, or maybe dance gave me disordered eating. I don’t have an answer to that question. I have been in dance spaces where no one seems to notice that I’m there, and where this feeling of being invisible was so debilitating that I got very very sick.

			I don’t know if my mental health issues are a result of being a dancer, or if I’ve always had them and I just decided to be a dancer. But I do know that dance is an extremely triggering space for me to work in. And if I could leave, I would, I would love to. But I don’t think I can, I feel like if I ever quit I would regret it for the rest of my life even though it’s so painful to do. I don’t have any strategies for keeping it healthy. I’m trying to learn to speak out when I feel uncomfortable in a situation. I’m trying to learn to value my relationships with the other dancers in a project above my need to please the choreographer. I’m trying to value that good work requires good and healthy working methods. I’m trying to be more deliberate about how I enter a dance space. I’m trying to do a lot of things and it’s hard work but I love dance too much to let hierarchy, sexism and body shaming stop me from continuing to work.

			I think the key is support from other dancers. Support from people you don’t feel competitive towards. I’ve tried having conversations about dance with non- dancers and they don’t seem to understand why I’d want to stay in a field that is so painful. But for me, it’s dance or bust.
