			When I was little, dancing and going to dance class was the most exciting part of each day. In the lead up to show time at the end of the year I would feel an electric swell of nervous excitement build up in my stomach, and then the moment I would come onto stage - well, nothing could ever beat it. I felt like I belonged there, and like I could finally be myself.

			As me and my body grew, my relationship with dancing (and ballet in particular) began to sour. The hyper-awareness of my body that dancing naturally brings was magnified during puberty when my body was changing, and growing bigger than those around me. Ballet classes became less about honing my technique and working hard and more about trying to hide myself, putting myself at the back where I wouldn’t be seen and staying out of conversations so there was less of a chance that people would look at me. Even my most sacred time of year, in the lead up to productions, my anxiety around being measured for costumes grew, and from that, anxiety about how they looked on me compared to the other girls. Offhand comments like ‘you’re a big girl aren’t you?’ and ‘your breasts have really come in now, wow!’ made me dread the measuring tape and have stayed with me to this day.

			It wasn’t until I did my first contemporary dance workshop that anyone said anything actually good about my body and my dancing. The teacher described my body as ‘athletic’, and praised the way I moved. It was one of the happiest days of my life. It gave me the first inkling I had that maybe there was a place for my body type in the dance world. In the years following that class, I came to notice that the more contemporary dance I did, the better I felt about myself, my dancing and my body. Now, thanks to contemporary dance, the hyper-awareness I have of my body isn’t a bad thing, and I know that strength is more important than aesthetic.

			‘Going through full time training was one of the most difficult things I’ve ever done in my life’ is a sentiment I imagine you’d hear from most people who have been through the rigour that comes with studying dance, and I’m no exception. However, as physically challenging as it was, for me it was almost more mentally challenging.

			In my first year, I had this paranoid sense that I was always being watched and harshly judged by my tutors. I thought that if I wasn’t working 100% of the time I was at uni, they wouldn’t think I was dedicated enough or that I wouldn’t make it. So I didn’t take proper breaks. Or, I took the bare minimum for functionality. I was anxious out of my mind that any time I stopped, ate anything that wasn’t healthy, took a break, or was a human being, I would be thought of as ‘weak’. The terror I felt ripped away that nervous excitement I had during performance seasons, and I began to just feel terrified, and then nothing. It still hasn’t come back. Back then I was also consumed by the toxic idea that we were all going to be competing for jobs at the end of uni, and so I compared myself to my classmates in a very unhealthy way. And then the injuries started popping up.

			I think dealing with injuries has almost taken the most strain on my mental state in dance, and does so for a lot of people. The thought that if I sat out of class I would get in my tutors’ ‘bad books’, or that they would see me as ‘lazy’ or ‘weak’ meant that I pushed through most of my injuries in the beginning. Dealing with an injury was bad enough without getting the stink eye from a tutor for sitting out of class, or being made to feel guilty about it. There was also an urgent fear of being left behind, while the class got better without me.

			Another facet of my dance-related-trauma comes from mentally and emotionally abusive choreographers and teachers. Sometimes, I would tell a friend about my day during a certain project and they would say something like ‘dude...that’s not okay, they can’t treat you like that’ I would just sigh and say that it’s just the way it is in the dance world, and that I probably deserved it. Now that I am out of it, I know that yelling at or demeaning your dancers or students should not be an accepted way of working for choreographers. Control through fear is something that I feel is so normal in dance, and it is not okay. Nor is it worth the physical improvements that come from being scared out of your mind that if you’re not working at maximum capacity all the time, you will be humiliated or screamed at. There were periods of sometimes months at a time where I would run to the bathrooms to have panic attacks during rehearsals, and that I would cry every night when I got home. I became so physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted that I hardly saw anyone or did anything outside of uni. I physically couldn’t, for the majority of the three years.

			When you’re in a training institution, it is very easy to feel trapped in abusive situations because you know the person at the front of the room will be grading you. That after you graduate, they are the ones who will be called by future employers to say if you are good enough for a job or not. This leads you to think they have some kind of control over your future career. And with the drive to succeed that many dancers have, this can be detrimental, and make you accept and push through trauma both mental and physical. But when you are in an institution, it’s easy to feel like you have no choice.

			It wasn’t until I graduated and experienced the industry for myself that I realised a large part of the contemporary dance industry is not like that. When you’re a freelancer, it is okay to take time to let injuries heal, and it is not often perceived as selfish or weak of you to do so. I have worked with kind people who acknowledge me to be a human being - not a dance machine - and trust me to know what is best for me. I’m not assumed to be lazy if I am having a rest, and I now feel comfortable taking things at my own pace. Experiencing different modes of working - ones that are holistic and are based not around the dance, but around each artist/dancer as a person - have helped me to begin to heal myself. And knowing that there are tonnes of different working methods to choose from makes me want to engage with an industry that I previously didn’t want to have any part in. Understanding how diverse this industry is, and that the culture of celebrating each other far outweighs the competitiveness I expected, makes me feel very excited to be part of this world.
